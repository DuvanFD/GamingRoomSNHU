# GamingRoomSNHU

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? 
  Gaming Room was a project consisting of a mobile-app game creator which main requirements were   to implement an Adnroid platform puzzle competition game. Client's intention was to have the     game available to multiple platforms besides Android like IOS and Windows. 
  
### What type of software did they want you to design?
  The business requirements focus on a cloud platform for the implementation of the game, as well   as memory and storage management, operating systems and host servers. 
  
### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The UML diagram is a very helpful tool to develop concise and straightforward objectives and methods that allow faster development and easy understandable code. 
  
### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  Perhaps by diving deeper into the research between the platforms on the client side, we could improve the comparing and constracting all the different operating systems. 
  
### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Key requirements to consider when developing the project, are speed and usability, as well as quality factors like user interface design and usage as well. Specially the focus is to have the app working the best  as possible so that the users are returning users and are able to use the app as it was intended. 
  

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  Business and technical requirements can be transalted into design documents including all aspects of the project as well as any mapping, between databases, strategy and infrastructure to have optimal code that fulfills all intended goals.
